Questions for Caleb:

> get rid of code redundancy (right now it's very bloated)

> auto image resize based on class?

json?

all things are currently tied to the veganate click function. Would it be better
to separate more?

defining siblings (ie are all div classes within a div id siblings?) - or should I use a different way to target?

Ideas to improve:

make css dynamic using math in the the js
 - so for hide elements position determined by adding # to top & left
 - from previous item in the list, and z index as well.
 - Color? could probably save a separate function to use color
from previous or have colors assigned to variables

make mobile friendly - possibly just one column where you paste in and results
come right into the box.

add math item?
